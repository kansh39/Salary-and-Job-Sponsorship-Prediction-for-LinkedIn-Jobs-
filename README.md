Salary and Job Sponsorship Prediction for LinkedIn Jobs
This project predicts salary ranges and job sponsorship likelihood using LinkedIn job data. It leverages machine learning to analyze job attributes and provide insights into salary expectations and visa sponsorship chances.

Features
Predicts salary ranges based on job descriptions, location, and experience.
Determines the likelihood of job sponsorship for work visas.
Utilizes scikit-learn and TensorFlow for model training and evaluation.
Data preprocessing performed using pandas and NumPy.
Dataset
The dataset includes job-related features such as:

Job title, company, and location
Salary information (if available)
Required experience and skills
Sponsorship availability
Note: The dataset is not included due to privacy concerns.
